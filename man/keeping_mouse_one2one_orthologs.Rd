\title{Convert Mouse Gene Matrix to Human Orthologs}
\usage{
keeping_mouse_one2one_orthologs(mat)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{Matrix. Gene expression matrix with mouse Ensemble gene identifiers as row
names and samples as columns.}
}
\value{
Matrix. Filtered gene expression matrix with human ortholog identifiers
as row names, containing only genes with confirmed one-to-one orthology.
}
\description{
Filters a gene expression matrix to retain only mouse genes that have one-to-one
human orthologs, then converts the mouse gene identifiers to their corresponding
human ortholog identifiers.
